## Introduction
Constraint satisfaction is a general problem solving technique for
solving a class of combinatorial optimization problems by imposing
limits on the values in the solution. The goal of this exercise is to
practice formulating some classical example problems as CSPs, and then
to explore using a powerful open source constraint satisfaction tool
called Z3 from Microsoft Research to solve them.

Two notebooks one to get acquainted with Z3 'intro_z3_solver' and the other one named 'constraint_satisfaction' containing several classical problems:
- Cryptarithmetic - introducing the Z3 API with simple word puzzles
- Map Coloring - solving the map coloring problem
- N-Queens - experimenting with problems that scale
- Sudoku - sudoku project with the Z3 solver
